    <h2 id="WestsideGunn"><strong>Westside Gunn</strong></h2>
    <p class="text">Alvin Lamar Worthy (born July 27, 1982), known professionally as Westside Gunn, is an American rapper, executive producer, and fashion designer, best known as the head and co-founder of independent hip-hop label Griselda Records. He founded the label with his paternal half-brother rapper Conway the Machine[1] and frequently collaborates with him alongside his cousin and fellow rapper Benny the Butcher. Gunn is recognized as one of the faces of the underground 2010s grimey boom bap resurgence, juxtaposing vivid drug-ridden street narratives, high fashion, and luxurious, artistic sample based production.

        He has released five studio albums in addition to an extensive catalog of mixtapes and EPs spanning back to 2005. His work with other rappers includes Tyler The Creator, Joey Badass, Travis Scott, Freddie Gibbs, Wale, JID, Denzel Curry, and Rick Ross among others and frequent collaborations with other members of the underground scene such as Stove God Cooks, Armani Caesar, Rome Streetz, Boldy James, Estee Nack, Daringer, The Alchemist, Conductor Williams, Beat Butcha, SadhuGold, Camoflauge Monk, and Denny Laflare. Gunn was affiliated with Shady Records from 2017 to 2020, but has since returned to independent status.</p>



    <h2 id="Griselda"><strong>Griselda</strong></h2>
    <p class="text">Griselda Records (also known as GriseldaxFR; GXFR) is an American independent hip hop record label based in Buffalo, New York. It was founded by rapper Westside Gunn, his brother Conway the Machine, and Mach-Hommy in 2012. In addition to the founding members, Benny the Butcher and in-house producer Daringer make up the flagship artists of the Griselda Records roster.

        The name Griselda comes from drug lord Griselda Blanco. Griselda refers to a loose-knit hip hop collective composed of the core signees of the label. The collective's de facto leader is the label's founder Westside Gunn. To date, Griselda has two releases as a collective: the extended play Don't Get Scared Now in 2016 and debut album WWCD in 2019.
        
        Beginning in the label's formative years, physical copies of the label's music were distributed in limited releases by London label Daupe! that often sold out within minutes.[1] In 2017, Griselda signed a distribution deal with Shady Records for artists Westside Gunn and Conway, which ended when both left the label in 2020 and 2022.[2] In 2019, Westside Gunn and Benny the Butcher signed a management deal with Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation.[3]
        
        In 2021, Benny and Westside Gunn produced and starred in the movie Conflicted, which received mixed reviews from critics.</p>

    <p class="text">Westside Gunn announced he was recording a project called Pray for Paris after having attended
        Virgil Abloh's Off-White Paris fashion show on January 18, 2020.[1] He revealed the album's artwork on April 3,
        2020.[2] The cover was created by Virgil Abloh using Caravaggio's David with the Head of Goliath.[3] During the
        album's recording Westside learned he had contracted COVID-19 and recounted having to do promotion for the album
        while suffering symptoms from the virus.[4] "A few days before dropping the album, Westside revealed that he
        contracted COVID-19 but has since recovered. "I have a confession to Make I’m a Corona Survivor," Westside wrote
        on IG. "I didn’t want anybody feeling sorry for me I had to thug it out for weeks I didn’t get to see my kids I
        went to the hospital feeling like I was breathing my last breath the fans and the love I was getting kept me
        strong."[5] Before the album's release, Westside Gunn and Virgil Abloh live-streamed the entire project on
        Twitch.[6]</p>

    <hr style="margin-left: 3%; width: 58%;">
    <p class="text">Alvin Lamar Worthy (born July 27, 1982), known professionally as Westside Gunn, is an American
        rapper, executive producer, and fashion designer, best known as the head and co-founder of independent hip-hop
        label Griselda Records. He founded the label with his paternal half-brother rapper Conway the Machine[1] and
        frequently collaborates with him alongside his cousin and fellow rapper Benny the Butcher. Gunn is recognized as
        one of the faces of the underground 2010s grimey boom bap resurgence, juxtaposing vivid drug-ridden street
        narratives, high fashion, and luxurious, artistic sample based production.

        He has released five studio albums in addition to an extensive catalog of mixtapes and EPs spanning back to
        2005. His work with other rappers includes Tyler The Creator, Joey Badass, Travis Scott, Freddie Gibbs, Wale,
        JID, Denzel Curry, and Rick Ross among others and frequent collaborations with other members of the underground
        scene such as Stove God Cooks, Armani Caesar, Rome Streetz, Boldy James, Estee Nack, Daringer, The Alchemist,
        Conductor Williams, Beat Butcha, SadhuGold, Camoflauge Monk, and Denny Laflare. Gunn was affiliated with Shady
        Records from 2017 to 2020, but has since returned to independent status.</p>



    <h2 id="Griselda"><strong>Griselda</strong></h2>
    <hr style="margin-left: 3%; width: 58%;">
    <p class="text">Griselda Records (also known as GriseldaxFR; GXFR) is an American independent hip hop record label
        based in Buffalo, New York. It was founded by rapper Westside Gunn, his brother Conway the Machine, and
        Mach-Hommy in 2012. In addition to the founding members, Benny the Butcher and in-house producer Daringer make
        up the flagship artists of the Griselda Records roster.

        The name Griselda comes from drug lord Griselda Blanco. Griselda refers to a loose-knit hip hop collective
        composed of the core signees of the label. The collective's de facto leader is the label's founder Westside
        Gunn. To date, Griselda has two releases as a collective: the extended play Don't Get Scared Now in 2016 and
        debut album WWCD in 2019.

        Beginning in the label's formative years, physical copies of the label's music were distributed in limited
        releases by London label Daupe! that often sold out within minutes.[1] In 2017, Griselda signed a distribution
        deal with Shady Records for artists Westside Gunn and Conway, which ended when both left the label in 2020 and
        2022.[2] In 2019, Westside Gunn and Benny the Butcher signed a management deal with Jay-Z's entertainment
        company Roc Nation.[3]

        In 2021, Benny and Westside Gunn produced and starred in the movie Conflicted, which received mixed reviews from
        critics.</p>

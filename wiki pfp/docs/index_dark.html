            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-White_(company)">Off-White</a> Paris fashion show on January
        18, 2020.[1] He revealed the album's artwork on April 3,

        album
        while suffering symptoms from the virus.[4] "A few days before dropping the album, Westside revealed that he
        contracted COVID-19 but has since recovered. "I have a confession to Make I'm a Corona Survivor," Westside wrote
        on IG. "I didn't want anybody feeling sorry for me I had to thug it out for weeks I didn't get to see my kids I
        went to the hospital feeling like I was breathing my last breath the fans and the love I was getting kept me
        strong."[5] Before the album's release, Westside Gunn and Virgil Abloh live-streamed the entire project on

    <h2 class="subtitle" id="critics"><strong>Critical Reception</strong></h2>
    <hr class="hr_subtitle">
    <p class="text">Pray for Paris received critical acclaim from critics. At Album of the Year, which assigns a
        normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77 based
        on six reviews.[14]

        Gregory Castel of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmilk">Earmilk</a> stated "Pray for Paris is a soulful yet, grimey masterpiece. This album is a
        handpicked selection of high-level artists, in lyricism, soulful production, and visual artwork".[8] Riley
        Wallace of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHopDX">HipHopDX </a>said, "Pray For Paris seems to show Gunn resisting being boxed-in artistically. For some
        critics who may have found past offerings more of an acquired taste, this is the camp's most inviting project to
        date".[10] Alphonse Pierre of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)">Pitchfork</a> stated "The Buffalo rapper continues his unlikely ascent into hip-hop
        stardom with an album of feverish excess and the best raps of his career".[11] In his Substack-published
        "Consumer Guide" column, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> said that "this album enjoys old-fashioned hip-hop materialism with
        dauntless esprit".[7] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclaim!">Exclaim!</a> reviewer A. Harmony said "Though Gunn's vintage sound might not work for
        everyone, Pray for Paris is a total delight for those who want to reminisce without feeling stuck in the
        past".[9]

        In another positive review, Dylan Green of DJ Booth stated "In the age of streaming and playlists, Pray For
        Paris further solidifies Westside Gunn as an album artist. He knows how to craft experiences from start to
        finish, what beats sound best next to each other, which features will yield the wildest results".[15] Ryan
        Middleton of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_(magazine)">Magnetic Magazine</a> said, "Despite this album having the sheen of opulence and examining fuck you
        money at the outset, it remains grounded with an ear to the streets."[16]</p>

        based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York">Buffalo, New York</a>. It was founded by rapper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westside_Gunn">Westside Gunn</a>, his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_the_Machine">Conway the Machine</a>, and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-Hommy">Mach-Hommy</a> in 2012. In addition to the founding members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_the_Butcher">Benny the Butcher</a> and in-house producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daringer_(producer)">Daringer</a> make

        The name Griselda comes from drug lord <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griselda_Blanco">Griselda Blanco</a>. Griselda refers to a loose-knit hip hop collective
        composed of the core signees of the label. The collective's de facto leader is the label's founder Westside

        debut album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWCD_(album)">WWCD</a> in 2019.

        Beginning in the label's formative years, physical copies of the label's music were distributed in limited
        releases by London label Daupe! that often sold out within minutes.[1] In 2017, Griselda signed a distribution
        deal with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shady_Records">Shady Records</a>  for artists Westside Gunn and Conway, which ended when both left the label in 2020 and
        2022.[2] In 2019, Westside Gunn and Benny the Butcher signed a management deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>'s entertainment
        company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_Nation">Roc Nation</a>.[3]

        In 2021, Benny and Westside Gunn produced and starred in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflicted_(film)">Conflicted</a>, which received mixed reviews from
        critics.</p>

            I blow your brains out in broad daylight (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
            You ever made love to the pot? I ain't think so
            You ever threw up from smellin' too many kilos?
            The Migos, Nigos, we reload the free throws
            The Margiela peacoat, the Regal
            Four story house I got off Ebro, the Vlone
            Rest in peace Vino (Ah), rest in peace Kino, the Spiegel
            The seagulls, April fresh ego
            Slam you on your neck like Bruno Sammartino
            Welcome home Tito, you proud and sippin' pinot
            My shooter shot five niggas in a row, we yell "Bingo", my Nino

            Ayo, I'm from a back block on the east side, peace and war
            Out on Leroy with the MAC on, peace Allah (brr)
            My whole portfolio is gangster, whip with cocaine
            Just shot a nigga on the anklet (Boom, boom, boom), sellin' dope
            Save this Persian rug five times a day, prayers, niggas tasteless
            Cells pop, niggas came through, stabbed 'em on the wakeup (ah)
            Niggas catch you at the showers for a hundred soups
            Bubble goose, we pulled up in a couple coupes (skrt)
            verse
            The chopper on double loop (doot, doot, doot, doot)
            Your body got hugged, but not enough to shoot
            We baggin' up trouble at the W
            What's up with you? We huntin' too (Ah)
            Still plottin' and schemin', on the cot, daydreamin'
            Get shot out the Heron, pray demon
            You ain't breathin' (skrt, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
            The yay reekin', your lips movin', you ain't breathin'
            You start coughin' up blood for the same reasons
            verse
            You ever sold a hundred then spent it all in the same weekend?
            Razors leave your face leakin' (Ah)
            Chill, let the Wraith creep, and the brick broke in eight pieces
            Double Cs on the suede sneakers, I kick the real shit
            Who you be? Where you bome from?
            I had to build shit (ah, I had to build shit, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
            I had to build shit (I had to build shit, boom, boom, boom, boom

            We really measure bricks (we really sold that)
            Shit was movin' fast as we cookin' up, we sell it quick (hah)
            Any beat I'm on, I gotta get my shit off
            Your watch ain't cost 30 and up?
            Take that shit off (take that shit off, nigga)
            I'm impactin' the culture like Eric Bischoff
            Big biscuit of that Biscotti makin' my bitch cough (cap)
            verse
            They on Google, they wonder what I got rich off
            They see me pullin' off in that Don, the top lift off (hah)
            The kid from May Street that used to whip soft (whip)
            And let his fif' off, now I'm the big boss
            I drop the bag, I have you picked off (boom, boom, boom, boom)
            My shooter don't speak but you can tell that he dangerous (cap)
            He just aims steady the stainless (hah)

            My life is definitely changin'
            Roc Nation brunch
            I'm with a R&B singer gettin' better acquainted (what up, baby?)
            If thou steal from FLYGOD, that's a sin
            It ain't another rapper that's alive that can match my pen
            Back again, MAC clap your men, stack the half an M
            I was him, before you ever heard me on
            A track with Em, it's The Machine, nigga
            verse
            Yo, look back, three years ago, when ain't nobody know me (nobody)

            Think it's a game until I Patrick Kane somebody homie
            That's slidin' through with a stick, shootin' one by the goalie (brr)
            I got nice, practice repeated, when rappers was decent
            When you ain't leave the house unless
            Your gat was matchin' your sneakers (yeah)

            Watch band snakeskin, gang at the door, let the apes in
            20K spent, that's how my day went
            Bulletproof the foreign to feel safe in (I'm good)
            Mirrors smoke grey tint, it's just to take trips to the bank in
            Telly by the border, Glock on top of the covers (yh huh)
            The room next door got duffles stacked on top of each other
            Me and my old plug alright (we cool), but we don't rock with each other
            That was only business
            And we done did a lot for each other (I made that nigga rich)
            verse
            Yeah, I'll fuck around and leave the party with
            My tool ringin' (boom, boom, boom, boom, let's go)

            Yeah, this for the corners that we anointed (anointed)
            Opened up with a small group of soldiers that I appointed (uh)
            I'm up due to all of the bullshit that I avoided

            My 327s was blessings, leather Vuitton vests
            Keep a loaded firearm in Mercedes armrests, Lord stressin' (Skrrt)
            Twenty-two with grays, twenty-five left in the cage
            I told him hold your head, it's worse in a grave
            I threw coke in the pot, watched it bloom residue and consume
            He started wavin', had a lighter and dope spoon
            A nigga try to kill you for your recipe
            My shooter nasal drip flowin' heavily, duckin' my third felony (Ah)
            Take your shine, two for five, me and mines
            Runnin' from suit and ties, you say you the flyest, then who am I?
            Balenciaga with the heel, lemonade a popular drink still
            VLONE jean jacket rockin', so be real (Ah)
            Over pots, I'm too exquisite
            On the dancefloor tryna finger fuck on every visit
            Some niggas'll never risk it
            Hoppin' in BMs in Prada moccasins, shit (Skrrt)
            They never had a pot to piss in
            Body parts on Cavalli dishes
            On Mulholland in the drop Porsche wildin', my loafers crocodile
            Stylin', I be havin' greater visions (Ah)
            You can tell by the way I whip it
            You gettin' money, then the haters with it

            I used to get kicked out of class just for my aroma
            I went to school high, forgot to pick up my diploma (I was high)

            Long way from that metro bus taxi service
            Long way, loco gangs tried to taxidermy (Where you from, nigga?)
            We would run until our motherfuckin' backs was burnin', uh
            But anyway, the shorts short and the socks high
            And the emeralds shine in them GQs and them Popeyes (Boy)

            Got the stove with the rose gold pilot, peep the science (Ah)
            On the island and we cookin' work, the violence
            Brick of coke pioneers, imagine laying on the cot
            Haven't seen your fam in years (Ah), lookin′ at old pics
            Droppin′ tears, my old celly live like that (Ah)
            Inshallah, I'm never goin′ back (Never goin' back)

            Hundred shots to whoever (brr), we want wars with the best (brr)
            Elephant trunks stuck to less (ah), four hundred thousand on the neck
            Knock off your head, fuck a vest (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
            You ever seen brains scattered? (Ah)
            Right in front of mama love
            That type of shit don't matter (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)

            Same fork was faithful

            Mafia, what else?
            227s, Blockworks
            verse
            Stood tall on that murder rock, the threat is on the compound
            Twenty-man tanks here, twenty four hour lockdown
            Was wanted on the net by the detects, number one suspected
            Callin' home collect, Auntie Nette the only one acceptin'
            One count felony firearm, two counts of drug possession
            Three counts of felonious assault without a murder weapon
            On the west side with 'bout thirty blicks, got the most gun collection
            Plus a whole array of thirty clips, with a whole drum selection
            verse
            Young and restless
            All my youngins scandalous, don't need none protection
            Undercovers pressin', wanna know what's me and Gunn connection
            Know the feds watchin', tryna catch us touchin' tons of metric
            Whole camp solid, snatch us up, you won't get one confession
            verse
            Hustlin' medication, takin' medicine for depression
            Under investigation never been the one to question
            Plug on my level, seen the talent from the first impression
            Russian cut my bezel, caesar salad with the Russian dressin'
            hook
            Ayo, Patek wrist (where we at?), took the cracks out the pots, geometrics bag the extras (ah)

            Ayo, you couldn't keep score, Patek Phillipe wars (ah)
            My niggas stare at Rugers
            Gucci bit off Iceberg shit, I still copped the Mickey
            Pissy elevators, hand in hand, I wore Issey, Lord, forgive me
            Fashion Week, I gave 'em headstarts to Mississippi (brr, brr, brr)
            Submachine guns, somebody fucked him, brains hangin' off the frame
            Blood on the Salvatore Mundi, we rock cocaine (ah)
            verse
            Tie-dye Dior floss, stickin' niggas up at Christie's
            Eugene Delacroixs for half price, leather strings and Rickys
            Ain't no eye for eye, you take an eye
            We take your whole head (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
            verse
            Shoppin' sprees at galleries, Lafayette, come here let's hold hands

            Pots dancin' with the grams of fish, whip game scandalous (ah)

            My heart got a thousand shadows on it
            His brain had a lead hollow in it
            Bloodbaths under the moonlight
            Spill his guts when the time is right
            verse
            Valentino for his favorite whore, homicidal couture
            Vintage Mizrahi in the streets of Paris
            Violence lingers inside me
            Extortion fills my bon appetit
            Hog tie him, make him watch a nigga nut in his wife
            verse
            He started to cry
            I kissed his cheek, then drove the icepick in his eye
            And one call will have a girl scout on your granddaddy's porch
            'Cause of death is heart attack on the coroner's report
            If he got a felony, it's guaranteed to excite me
            Gun and drug charges give me butterflies
            Evil as Satan, but I see God all in his eyes
            outro
            Ayo, it's Westside Pootie
            And my Lamborghini got a backseat, and y'all drive rentals
            In other words, get your weight up
            Y'all still broke
            Oh, yeah, and stop copyin' off my daddy, too
            It's Griselda
